This code is intended to be an implementation of a paper that I am working on. This paper aims to propose theories needed to have an automated policy insertion and verification for ML.
This project is an implementation of that project. The paper, the code, the documentation, credits (the initial code is from ocaml: http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/u3-ocaml/ocaml-ml.html ) and neccessary open source licence will be completed later!

Hope you enjoy this and find it useful!
