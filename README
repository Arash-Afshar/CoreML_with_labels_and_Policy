This code is intended to be an simple implementation of a the paper titled "Reconstructing security types 
for automated policy enforcement in FABLE".

This paper aims to propose formal constructs needed to have an automated policy insertion and verification
in a functional language, such as ML. This code, implements these constructs and is a branch of my previous
custom implementation of a simple ML language (call CoreML).

The code is released under normal GPL terms.

Hope you enjoy this and find it useful!
