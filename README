This code is intended to be a simple implementation of the paper titled "Reconstructing security types 
for automated policy enforcement in FABLE". This paper aims to propose formal constructs needed to have
an automated policy insertion and verification in a functional language, such as ML.

This code implements these constructs and is a branch of my previous work (a custom implementation of a 
simple ML language (called CoreML)).

The code is released under normal GPL terms.

Hope you enjoy this and find it useful!
